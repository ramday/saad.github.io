      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The Equity Equation Project seeks to revolutionize education planning in Pakistan by developing a sophisticated computational model to address the persistent challenge of over <strong>26 million out-of-school children</strong>.
        By leveraging advanced computational techniques, this initiative aims to empower policymakers with evidence-based insights to drastically increase school enrollment,
        especially among marginalized communities.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project employs advanced techniques in agent-based modeling (ABM), causal graphical modeling, and spatial analysis to simulate the impact of various policies on school enrollment.
        By integrating diverse datasets—including census data, household surveys, and GIS information—the model provides policymakers with a powerful tool to understand the complex interplay of factors influencing educational access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers with expertise in computational modeling, machine learning, and geographic information systems (GIS) are invited to collaborate on this cutting-edge initiative.
        Our approach promises to identify optimal policy interventions that can lead to increased enrollment and enhanced equity in education.

        The interactive chart below represents a sample simulation of how various policy interventions could influence school enrollment over time.
        The dataset is illustrative and draws upon global trends reported by organizations such as the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF.
